# Project Description
An application that uses a machine learning model to analyze text and classify it into three categories: positive or negative sentiment. Before generating text the user can choose 4 models because the model was built using the Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and random forest algorthm. The output of this project can help determine whether a statement expresses a positive, neutral or negative sentiment.
